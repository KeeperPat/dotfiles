= Patrick Joyce Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

This technique is taken from Ryan Bates dotfiles project, but I removed all of his settings as I
want to gradually port my preferred personal configuration to this repository.

== Installation

  git clone git://github.com/KeeperPat/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install
